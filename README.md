This application is a Netflix look like clone that is built using React Custom Hooks, Context. I have used Firebase & Styled Components. This application consist of the following pages such as sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, which using protected routes with auth listeners. The Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook. I have used authentication on sign in and sign up pages using the Firebase.I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build components, The styling is handled using styled components.
